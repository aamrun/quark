Quantum Computing Library providing functionality from fundamental to advanced methods.

This library aims to provide Quantum Computation methods from the most fundamental to advanced implementations, such as quantum equivalents of classical methods and implementations which are only possible by quantum methods.

Initially to be developed on and for classical systems, the library aims to operate on both classical and quantum systems as far as possible. For implementations where this is not possible, quantum implementations will be preferred.

Implementations to be done in C and Python and eventually in Quantum Programming languages.
